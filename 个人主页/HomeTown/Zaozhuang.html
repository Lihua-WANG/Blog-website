<p id="1">Zaozhuang follows Peter Parker as he is bitten by a "super-spider", which causes him to take on the traits of a spider. Following the murder of his uncle, Peter spends his whole life to fighting crime. Norman Osborn, in an attempt to save his company, experiments with human performance-enhancing drugs. The drugs cause Norman to go crazy. When Spider-Man refuses to join the Green Goblin, the two face off against each other in an epic battle.
